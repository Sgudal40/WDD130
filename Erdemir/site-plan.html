      <p>
        Step into Erdemir, a land where ancient civilizations rise and fall, where myths are forged in steel and sorcery, and where every step carries the weight of history. This is a continent shaped by gods and kings, by war and trade, by the wild and the unknown. <br>
        The echoes of fallen empires linger in long-forgotten ruins, while untamed magic weaves through the land, waiting to be harnessed—or feared. Myths walk beside mortals, shaping destinies in ways both wondrous and perilous. Faith and ambition spark the rise of kingdoms, while the shadows of the past whisper secrets to those daring enough to listen. <br>
        Whether drawn by adventure, knowledge, or power, those who step onto this land will find that history is still being written. <br> 
        Will your name be among its legends?

      </ul>
      <h3>Myria territory</h3>
      <p>
        Myria’s Territory is a land of two realms, one above the waves and one beneath them. On the surface, a proud kingdom of landfolk thrives on a peninsula, its castle town standing as a beacon of seafaring trade and diplomacy. Below, an ancient underwater civilization of merfolk and aquatic beings flourishes in a shimmering domain reminiscent of a lost Atlantis, with towering coral spires and bioluminescent halls. <br> <br>
        Bound by an unshakable alliance, these twin kingdoms have long endured where others might have fallen. Trade flows freely between them, their ships and currents carrying goods, culture, and magic between land and sea. Though vastly different in nature, both societies are deeply intertwined, their fates linked by the tides that shape their world. <br> <br>
        Yet, Myria’s strength is not without its challenges. The ocean holds secrets older than the kingdoms themselves, and the unity between land and sea is not always absolute. Pirates, deep-sea horrors, and unseen tensions threaten to disrupt the balance, making Myria a place of both opportunity and peril for those who seek adventure, power, or fortune.

      </ul>
      <h3>New Varon</h3>
      <p>
        New Varon is a land where time holds little meaning, a kingdom where the past lingers, and the future is all but certain. The cities stand in eerie, ageless grandeur, built not for the fleeting concerns of the living but for an eternity of existence. Its rulers, its workers, its scholars—many have walked these streets for centuries, unfazed by the weight of years. <br> <br>

        Travelers who enter quickly learn that New Varon is not hostile to the living, but neither does it cater to them. Laws are written with the assumption that permanence is inevitable. Bureaucrats and merchants deal in contracts that extend beyond a single lifetime. Temples and scholars speak not of what comes after death, but of how best to prepare for it. There is always another form, another purpose, another role waiting to be filled. <br> <br>
        
        For those who linger too long, the question is not whether they will change—but whether they will be the ones to decide how.
