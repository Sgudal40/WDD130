            <h2>📜 Backstory 📜</h2>
            <p>Nettle grew up in Sonace, a town surrounded by the dark and magical Maspa forest. Though never treated cruelly, he always felt like an outsider. His love for plants and potions kept him engaged, especially through his friendship with Flotti, a Kenku whose master was a potion brewer. A tragic event severed his last ties to Sonace, leading him to venture into the world in search of purpose.</p>
